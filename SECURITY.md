## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, please report it by creating a [Security Advisory](https://github.com/VLADos-IT/lastfm-github-profile/security/advisories/new) or by contacting the maintainer directly.
